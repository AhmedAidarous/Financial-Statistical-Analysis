# Value Investing 
**Value Investing** is an investment philosophy which selects undervalued stocks 
(market value less than intrinsic value) despite sound financial and operational metrics. 
Value investors perform rigours analysis of the fundamentals and try to buy the stock at a discount 
compared to the intrinsic value calculated.
<br><br>
In a nutshell, it’s all about paying less than the security’s value, and therefore profit is realized 
when the price reverts back to the value it deserves. 
<br><br>
Value investors consider price and value to be distinct Therefore due to that, quantitative approach 
affords investors with the possibility of analyzing vast number of stocks by harnessing computational power. 
<br><br>
There are two main methods for quantitative analysis for value investing, these are:
<br>
• **Joel Greenblatt’s Magic Formula 
<br>
•	Piotrowski F-Score**
<br>

The following explains both methods

## Magic Formula
This investment philosophy, first introduced in the book “The little book that beats the market” strategy is an investment approach centered around identifying “wonderful stocks” at “bargain price”.
<br><br>
The term Wonderful Stock quantified by the metric Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) which measures bang-for-buck on actual capital employed. This excludes excess cash and interes-bearing assets to focus only on assets that actually are used in the business to generate the return.
<br><br>
Bargain price which was quantified by earning yield is defined as the ratio of EBIT to enterprise value (Line P/E ratio but capital structure independent)
<br><br>
The method goes to invest in the top 20 – 30 companies (This excludes finance and insurance companies), accumulating 2-3 positions per month, over a 12-month period. Then Re-balance the portfolio once a year.


## Piotrowski F-Score
This metric was developed by Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotrowski, and this methodology is very popular and it's used very often. What is essentially does is give you a score which ranges between 0-9, and this score assesses a company's financial position. Where 9 being the best and 0 being the worst.
<br><br>
Piotroski F-score has a few criterias, the following are as such:
### Profitability Criteria
• If there is a positive return on assets in the current year = +1 point 
<br>• If there is a positive operating cash flow in the current year  = +1 point
<br>• Return on assets, and it's higher in the current year compared to the previous year = +1 point
<br>• Cashflow from operations / total assets greater than ROA in the current year = +1 point

### Leverage, Liquidity and Source of Funds Criteria:
<br>• Lower ratio of long term debt in the current period, compared to the previous year (decreased leverage) = 1 point
<br>• Higher current ratio this year comapred to the previous year (more liquidity) = 1 point
<br>• No new shares were issued in the last year = 1 point

### Operating Efficiency Criteria:
• A higher gross margin compared to the previous year = 1 point
<br>• Higher current ratio this year comapred to the previous year = 1 point
The solution picks stocks with a score 8-9 and rebalance every 6 months or 1 year! Best results are observed in mid cap and small cap stocks.
