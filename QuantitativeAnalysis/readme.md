# Value Investing 
**Value Investing** is an investment philosophy which selects undervalued stocks 
(market value less than intrinsic value) despite sound financial and operational metrics. 
Value investors perform rigours analysis of the fundamentals and try to buy the stock at a discount 
compared to the intrinsic value calculated.
<br><br>
In a nutshell, it’s all about paying less than the security’s value, and therefore profit is realized 
when the price reverts back to the value it deserves. 
<br><br>
Value investors consider price and value to be distinct Therefore due to that, quantitative approach 
affords investors with the possibility of analyzing vast number of stocks by harnessing computational power. 
<br><br>
There are two main methods for quantitative analysis for value investing, these are:
<br>
• **Joel Greenblatt’s Magic Formula 
<br>
•	Piotrowski F-Score**
<br>

The following explains both methods

## Magic Formula
This investment philosophy, first introduced in the book “The little book that beats the market” strategy is an investment approach centered around identifying “wonderful stocks” at “bargain price”.
<br><br>
The term Wonderful Stock quantified by the metric Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) which measures bang-for-buck on actual capital employed. This excludes excess cash and interes-bearing assets to focus only on assets that actually are used in the business to generate the return.
<br><br>
Bargain price which was quantified by earning yield is defined as the ratio of EBIT to enterprise value (Line P/E ratio but capital structure independent)
<br><br>
The method goes to invest in the top 20 – 30 companies (This excludes finance and insurance companies), accumulating 2-3 positions per month, over a 12-month period. Then Re-balance the portfolio once a year.
