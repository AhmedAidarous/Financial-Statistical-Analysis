# Financial Health Metrics
There's no one perfect way to determine a company's financial health, let alone sustainability, despite investors' best efforts. 
To accurately evaluate the financial health and long-term sustainability of a company, several financial metrics must be considered in tandem. These are:
<br>• **Liquidity 
<br>• Solvency 
<br>• Profitability 
<br>• Operating Efficiency** 
However, the most significant would be a company’s profitability.

Now that is out of the way, lets look in-depth at the four metrics above:


## Liquidity 
**Liquidity** is a key factor in assessing a company’s basic financial health. Liquidity is the amount of cash and easily convertible to cash assets a company owns to manage it’s short-term debt obligations. Before a company can prosper in the long term, it must first be able to survive in the short term.
There are ways to measure liquidity, however the most recommended approach to calculating this would be using the **The Quick Ratio**.

### The Quick Ratio
**The Quick Ratio** is a conservative measure, this is because it excludes inventory from assets and also excludes the current part of long-term debt from liabilities. Therefore it provides a more realistic and practical indication of a company’s ability to manage short term obligations with cash and assets on hand.

A quick ratio of 1 is considered to be the normal quick ratio. It indicates that the company is fully equipped with exactly enough assets to be instantly liquidated to pay off its current liabilities. 

A company that has a quick ratio of less than 1 may not be able to fully pay off its current liabilities in the short term, while a company having a quick ratio higher than 1 can instantly get rid of its current liabilities.
Therefore the following are the three categories are:
<br>• QuickRatio > 1	= VERY HEALTHY
<br>• QuickRatio < 1  = NOT HEALTHY
<br>•	QuickRatio = 1  = NORMAL


The following are the two the formulae to calculate the Quick Ratio:

## Solvency
Solvency is related to liquidity and it's a company’s ability to meet its debt obligations on an ongoing basis, not just over the short term. Solvency ratios calculate a company’s long term debt in relation to it’s assets or equity.

### D/E Ratio
The **debt-to-equity ratio (D/E)** ratio is generally a solid indicator of a company’s long-term sustainability because it provides a measurement of debt against a stockholder’s equity, and is therefore also a measure of an investor’s interest and confidence in a company. 

A lower **D/E** ratio means more of a company’s operations are being financed by shareholders than by the creditors. This is a plus for a company since shareholders don’t charge interest on the financing they provide.

The following is the formula to calculate D/E ratio:

<br>

D/E ratios vary widely between industries. However, regardless of the specific nature of a business, a downward trend over time in the D/E ratio is a good indicator a company is on increasingly solid financial ground. 

**The optimal D/E ratio varies by industry, but it should not be above a level of 2.0.**


## Operating Efficiency
A company’s operating efficiency is the key to it’s financial success. One of the best indicators for operating efficiency is Operating Margin. 
The Operating Margin metric considers a company's basic operational profit margin after deducting the variable costs of producing and marketing the company's products or services. It indicates how well the company's management is able to control costs.

Good management is essential to a company's long-term sustainability, it can overcome an array of temporary problems, while bad management can lead to the collapse of even the most promising business.

The following is the formula to calculate the Operating Efficiency:

<br>

For most businesses, an operating margin higher than **15% is considered good**, it also helps to look at trends in operating margin to see if past years indicate that operating margin is going up or down. So the company could be having a ratio above 15%, however if its been declining, then its not a good sign, but its still good for now.


## Profitability 
While liquidity, basic solvency, and operating efficiency are all important factors to consider in evaluating a company, a company’s profitability is it’s most important metric. Companies can survive for years without being profitable, operating on the goodwill of creditors and investors. But to survive in the long run, **a company must eventually attain and maintain profitability.**
A very good metric to use to evaluate profitability is net margin. 

To calculate net margin, you use the following formula:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47617364/130346929-74968c83-2064-4687-ab99-cada21766d6a.png)
 <br>
The result is a percentage. 

### Net Profit Margin 
Net profit margin is one of the most important indicators of a company's financial health. By tracking increases and decreases in its net profit margin, a company can assess whether current practices are working and forecast profits based on revenues. Because companies express net profit margin as a percentage rather than a dollar amount, it is possible to compare the profitability of two or more businesses regardless of size.

Investors can assess if a company's management is generating enough profit from its sales and whether operating costs and overhead costs are being contained. 

For example, *a company can have growing revenue, but if its operating costs are increasing at a faster rate than revenue, its net profit margin will shrink. Ideally, investors want to see a track record of expanding margins, meaning that the net profit margin is rising over time.*

*A company might show a net profit figure of several hundred million dollars, but if that dollar figure represents a net margin of **only 1% or less**, then even the slightest increase in operating costs or marketplace competition could plunge the company into the red. A larger net margin, especially compared to industry peers, means a greater margin of financial safety, and also indicates a company is in a better financial position to commit capital to growth and expansion.
