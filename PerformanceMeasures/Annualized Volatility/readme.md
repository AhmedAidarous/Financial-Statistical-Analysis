# Annualized Volatility
Volatility is represented as the standard deviation of the returns of an investment. This captures the variability of 
returns from the mean return. the higher the volatility, the riskier the security, however the larger the potential
returns if played smart.

Now annualized volatility simply is the measure of the volatility at a given time period, this is achieved
by multiplying the **standard deviation** with the following square root values:
<br>
• **To get the annualized daily volatility, you should multiply with √252 - There are 252 trading days in a week
<br>
• To get the annualized weekly volatility, you should multiply with √52 - There are 52 trading weeks in a year
<br>
• To get the annualized monthly volatility, you should multiply with √12 - There are 12 trading months in a year**
 
The issue with such a measure of volatility is though its widely used, this approach assumes normal distribution 
of returns which isn't true. Moreover it doesn't capture tail risk.
