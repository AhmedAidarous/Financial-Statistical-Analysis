# Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
CAGR is one of the most important performance measure. Even when you're investing in investing in a mutual fund, 
the first thing you would look at is what is the CAGR.

CAGR is the annual rate of return realized by an asset to reach it's current market value from it's initial value. 
**The best way to think about it is if say you invested $1 in te stockmarket for say TSLA stock. That invest in 
say 5 years time becomes $2. So effectively in 5 years, your investment has doubled. So effectively your total annualized return 
is 100%.** 

The following is the formula to calculate CAGR:

## Benefit
CAGR provides the benefit of providing an ease of comparison between different trading strategies. 

## Drawback
A drawback to such an investment strategy is the fact that it doesn't reflect investment risk and therefore should be 
used in conjunction with a volatility measuring metric.
