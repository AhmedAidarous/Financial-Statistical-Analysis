# Technical Indicators

## Bolinger Bands
Bollinger Bands, a technical indicator developed by John Bollinger, are used to measure a market’s volatility and identify “overbought” or “oversold” conditions. Basically, this little tool tells us whether the market is quiet or whether the market is LOUD!
When the market is quiet, the bands contract and when the market is LOUD, the bands expand.

Using the Bollinger bands python file will generate the following output graph format:

This graph was made to be interactive, and has the bollinger band areas shaded to show the volatility of the market.
